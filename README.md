# poi-api
This is an API created for a take-home challenge by Foundry Spatial.
When a request is made to /poi, the API returns the latitude and longitude of Kuma Noodle Japan,
a favourite lunchtime spot in Victoria.
Created using Node and ExpressJs.

The app is deployed to http://jj-poi-api.herokuapp.com/.
